The Handwritten Digit and Letter Recognition showcase aims to develop 
a machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits (0-9)
and letters (A-Z, both uppercase and lowercase) from images. This project explores the 
intersection of machine learning and computer vision to tackle a classic pattern recognition problem.
The project follows a structured approach, starting with data preprocessing to prepare 
the dataset for model training. Various machine learning algorithms are implemented and 
trained on the dataset to achieve optimal classification performance.Through iterative 
experimentation and model refinement, the project focuses on improving accuracy, precision,
and recall metrics to ensure robust and reliable recognition of handwritten characters.
By completing this project, participants gain practical experience in image classification,model building, 
evaluation, and deployment, laying a strong foundation in both machine learning and computer vision domains.
